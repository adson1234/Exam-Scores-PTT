What about ROC (receiver operating characteristic) and AUC (area under the curve) with various probability thresholds?   

\textcolor{red}{Need to state why ROC and AUC are good metrics for the model.}   

At the beginning of Section \ref{in-sample}, we used 0.5 as the default probability threshold to classify whether a student would obtain **College_Score** at least 65 or not. This is acceptable because the data are balanced and 48.9% of students in the data made the cut, i.e., obtained **College_Score** at least 65.      

But the threshold of 0.5 may not be appropriate in imbalanced datasets.   

\textcolor{red}{Provide some examples here}    

In many situations, it is not obvious to determine the probability threshold to predict a datapoint to be positive.   

\textcolor{red}{You have to do the full implementation; don't just write a few lines as a pointer to the concepts.}     

Code line: data.frame(TPR=cumsum(labels)/sum(labels), FPR=cumsum(!labels)/sum(!labels), labels)
