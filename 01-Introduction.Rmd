The author grew up in Taiwan, so we are curious about the relationship between the high school entrance exam score percentiles and the college entrance scores in Taiwan. It seems obvious that a greater percentage of students from top high schools get admitted to prestigious universities.^[<https://bit.ly/2JSPXKc>]  However, the high school entrance exam is much easier than the college entrance exam, so some people studied little in middle school and was able to get into a good high school. Then some of these people kept studying little and ended up with a bad score on the college entrance exam. On the other hand, we have also seen some students from mediocre high schools studied very hard, and eventually earned a stellar score in the college exam. Therefore, we decided to gather data and create our own analysis. The target audience of this document would be people with a basic understanding of statistics, equivalent to taking or having completed Statistics 101.

Since we do not have the official data from the Taiwan government that links people between their scores on the high school entrance exam and college entrance exam, it is difficult to obtain a representative sample of people's scores. Therefore, we obtained self-reported data from an existing post^[<https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/SENIORHIGH/M.1432729401.A.995.html>] in 2015 on PTT, the largest terminal-based bulletin board in Taiwan. Each of the 197 rows of the data contains an anonymous ID, high school entrance exam score (in the form of percentile rank), and college entrance exam score.

For the rest of this article, we begin with a short background of Taiwan's high school and college entrance exams, followed by the description of our dataset. We start the technical content with exploratory data analysis, in order to identify and visualize the distribution of exam scores. Next, we explain our decisions in statistical modeling, such as whether a linear regression is appropriate or not. We also take a closer look at the top scorers, because they typically came from prestigious high schools and/or colleges. Then we move on to introduce advanced models like logistic regression. Finally, we provide our discussion, state our conclusion, and give some personal remarks.  

The goal of writing this document is to instruct the readers on how to perform data analysis using fundamental machine learning concepts. We focus on demonstrating the methodology, so the coding implementation may not be perfectly optimized.
