Most graphs in this manuscript are mainly for demonstration; they are created using the basic `plot` function as the default in RStudio. For advanced data visualization, we highly encourage readers to use the $\mathsf{R}$ package `ggplot2` \cite{ggplot2}. This package incorporates data visualization theory and provides much more capability to convey the message in a graph.        

The code is also for demonstration. To learn about better coding styles, we recommend the computer science books *Clean Code* \cite{martin2009clean} and *Code Complete* \cite{mcconnell2004code}.
