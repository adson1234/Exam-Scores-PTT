RStudio, code reproducibility, etc.  

Need to specify the $\mathsf{R}$ libraries.  

This document was created in RStudio, using $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown \cite{r-markdown-pkg} with `knitr` to PDF.^[<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html>]  

$\mathsf{R}$ Markdown can also generate reports in HTML and Microsoft Word formats.   

What about $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown for presentation slides?   

Supporting file formats  

State why it is error-prone to copy-paste tables and plots to the word processor for the final report \cite{baumer2014r-markdown}.   

Most graphs in this manuscript are mainly for demonstration; they are created using the basic `plot` function as the default in RStudio. For advanced data visualization, we highly encourage readers to use the $\mathsf{R}$ package `ggplot2` \cite{ggplot2}. This package incorporates data visualization theory and provides much more capability to convey the message in a graph.       

$\mathsf{R}$ package `tidyverse`?  

Consider adding books about data visualization theory  

The code is also for demonstration. The author makes every effort to ensure correctness and readability of the code, but errors and inconsistencies are inevitable. Since this is an open-source project on GitHub,^[<https://github.com/star1327p/Exam-Scores-PTT>], readers are welcome to make a pull request and/or report any issues. To learn more about better coding styles, we recommend the computer science books *Clean Code* \cite{martin2009clean} and *Code Complete* \cite{mcconnell2004code}.
