RStudio, code reproducibility, etc.  

Need to specify the $\mathsf{R}$ libraries.  

This document was created in RStudio, using $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown \cite{r-markdown-pkg} with `knitr` to PDF.^[<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html>] $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown can generate reports in HTML and Microsoft Word formats as well. In addition to reports, $\mathsf{R}$ Markdown also provides a template for presentation slides, and the output can be in HTML, PDF, and Microsoft PowerPoint files.   

State why it is error-prone to copy-paste tables and plots to the word processor for the final report \cite{baumer2014r-markdown}.   

The graphs in this manuscript are mainly for demonstration; they are created using the basic `plot` function as the default in RStudio. For advanced data visualization, we highly encourage readers to use the $\mathsf{R}$ package `ggplot2` \cite{ggplot2}. This package incorporates data visualization theory and provides much more capability to convey the message in a graph.       

$\mathsf{R}$ package `tidyverse`?  

Consider adding books about data visualization theory, citations needed  

- *The Grammar of Graphics*^[<https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl>]

- Add something more  

The code is also for demonstration. The author makes every effort to ensure correctness and readability of the code, but errors and inconsistencies are inevitable. Since this is an open-source project on GitHub,^[<https://github.com/star1327p/Exam-Scores-PTT>], readers are welcome to make a pull request and/or report any issues. To learn more about better coding styles, we recommend the computer science books *Clean Code* \cite{martin2009clean} and *Code Complete* \cite{mcconnell2004code}.
