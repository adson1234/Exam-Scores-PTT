We briefly explain the high school and college entrance exams in Taiwan for readers all over the world. Like many other places in Asia, Taiwan puts heavy emphasis on standardized tests in high school and college admissions.^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Taiwan>] This is different from the US college admission system, which values more of students' overall qualifications such as extracurricular activities and personal qualities, not solely on a single test score.^[<https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/college-application-process>]

Topic sentence: Needs to be polished.  
Taiwan has started to value students' extracurricular activities and personal qualities in addition to the test score ??

Despite multiple attempts of education reform, the high school entrance exam in Taiwan remains a key part to high school admissions \cite{chen2017advancing, chen2008strategic}.   

What about the college entrance exam in Taiwan? More complicated system.  



## High School Entrance Exam in Taiwan {#HighSchool_PR}

\textcolor{red}{Focus on how the max total scores was revised over time. Don't go deep into commentaries or how the society reacted to the changes.}  

\textcolor{red}{What aggregated data does the Taiwan government publish?}  

Between 2001 and 2013, the high school entrance exam in Taiwan was officially called The Basic Competence Test for Junior High School Students \cite{chou2007schooling}.^[<https://bit.ly/2JNQaOI>] The exam was typically held in May-June and consisted of five subjects (Chinese, English, mathematics, physical sciences, and social sciences). The report card contains exam scores for each subject, the total score, and the percentile rank (PR values from 1 to 99) of the total score. The PR value refers to the percentage of the student population you scored higher than. For example, PR 86 means you have a higher score than 86% of the student population in Taiwan. The PR values serve as a normalized tool to compare academic achievements across years.   

The actual exam score range varied from year to year. In 2001-2006, each of the five subjects had a maximum score of 60, summing up to a total score of 300. In Year 2007, the independent essay question was added for another 12 points, bringing up the maximum total score to 312 points.^[<https://www.945enet.com.tw/epaper/contents/ha/048/03.htm>] The scoring of the high school entrance exam had been controversial and generated much discussion in the news.^[<https://web.archive.org/web/20090415123425/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2007/new/jun/21/today-life1.htm>] The main issue was the large score difference between full marks and getting only one question wrong in a test subject.^[<https://blog.xuite.net/wmhsu/twblog/147553826>] For instance, one could get a 60 with all questions correct in a subject, but only 55 by missing just one question. The five-point deduction was regarded as a harsh penalty, given that the knowledge difference was minimal between a perfect score and a near-perfect score.^[<https://m.xuite.net/blog/chioufatymjh/twblog/130262492>]   

\section*{\textcolor{red}{Unfinished below}}  

Then in Year 2009, the maximum possible score was increased from 312 to 412 points.^[<https://blog.cybertranslator.idv.tw/archives/2384>] Each subject was augmented from 60 to 80 points, and the independent essay question was still worth 12 points. In the 80-point system, missing one question would result in a two-point loss from the full mark, rather than a substantial five or six points.^[<https://joan044.pixnet.net/blog/post/255140987>]    

\textcolor{red}{What happened in 2010 and 2011, respectively?}   

\textcolor{red}{When were two opportunities given each year? When did it become only one test?}    

Year 2012 had only one test,^[<https://m.xuite.net/blog/penghu.dialy/blog/61024095>] and Year 2013 was the same.^[<https://www.ettoday.net/news/20130609/220042.htm>] Note that Year 2013 was the final year to use the PR values in the high school entrance exam.  

A major reform came in Year 2014, and the PR values were replaced with seven letter grades for each subject (C, B, B+, B++, A, A+, A++) and an independent essay score (0-6).^[<https://www.parenting.com.tw/article/5049351>]    

\textcolor{red}{How are the new letter grades used for high school admission decisions?}

What are the outcomes?  

## College Entrance Exam in Taiwan {#College_Score}

\textcolor{red}{Describe the early admission and the regular admission rules separately.}  

\textcolor{red}{What aggregated data does the Taiwan government publish?}  

The college entrance exams in Taiwan are held twice a year; the first exam is for early admission and the second exam is for regular admission \cite{chou2015higher}.   

The first exam is called the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT) starting in 1994, which is typically held in late January or early February.^[<https://bit.ly/2W0fdUq>] Students can use the GSAT scores and additional criteria (i.e., their portfolio documents) to apply to colleges for early admission \cite{hsieh2019preliminary}.

The second exam is called the Advanced Subjects Test (AST) starting in 2002, and it is almost always held on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd each year.^[<https://bit.ly/2J7YxoW>] In the regular admission phase, the AST scores are directly used for college placements \cite{shy2021comparison}, without consideration of the student's achievements outside the AST scores.^[With limited exceptions of GSAT score requirements. <https://udn.com/news/story/121570/4773243>]     

\textcolor{red}{Elaborate on the new regular admission rules starting in 2022}   

In 2022, AST was replaced with a completely new scoring system,^[<https://www.ceec.edu.tw/unithome?psid=0J129606443348127072>] and we do not have sufficient data for this part yet.^[<https://www.cw.com.tw/article/5119369>]   


\textcolor{red}{Continue writing below}  

The GSAT consists of five subjects (Chinese, English, mathematics, physical sciences, and social sciences), each of which are graded on a 0 to 15 point scale. The GSAT scores are normalized to a range of 0 to 75, regardless of the difficulty level of GSAT each year. On the other hand, the scores of AST can vary widely because each subject is scored separately from 0 to 100. Since the AST scores fluctuate more due to the difficulty level of the exam questions each year, we decided to use the GSAT scores as a benchmark of the college exam scores.  

\textcolor{red}{How is the 0 to 15 point scale calculated?}^[<https://bit.ly/3bxIuSn>]    

1. Compute the "top" as the average raw score of the highest 1% among test takers.
2. Divide the number by 15 to get the scale interval.
3. Create a table to map raw scores to the 0 to 15 point scale.

For example, if a subject has the "top" of 93.45 (max 100), then the scale interval is 93.45/15 = 6.23, rounded to two decimal points. Zero point is reserved for absolute zero marks on the exam. A student will get 1 point for a raw score between 0.01 and 6.23, and 2 points for a raw score between 6.24 and 12.46, and so on. If we observe from the top of the scale, a student can get 15 points for a raw score between 87.23 and 100, and 14 points for a raw score between 81.00 and 87.22. Note that the threshold (87.23) to achieve 15 points is 14 times of the scale interval (6.23).   

Starting in 2019, students may choose four of the five subjects for the GSAT, and the maximum possible score (i.e., full marks) is reduced from 75 to 60.  

Starting in 2019, high school students are also required to maintain a portfolio each semester to document their learning outcomes.^[<https://www.108epo.com/courses.php>]
